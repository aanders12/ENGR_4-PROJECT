# BLIMP MOBILE

The design will be broken into three fragments: The propeller, The blimp, and The hot-box.

The propeller:
  an optional piece, 3d parts ment to give the blimp direction so it not only goes up but forward.
  
The blimp:
  a robust figure filled with helium (or some other form of flight movement) built with a wooden frame and secured with wood glue.
  
The hot-box:
  where the wiring will be in the design. A small wooden box secured with nuts and bolts.

## Planning
  
  loose measurments for basis : four feet in length, 1-2 feet in height, and 1-2 feet in width.  

### Bill of Materials
  - thin ply-wood
  - blimp paper (a sturdy paper sheet, or Mylar)
  - helium (hot air alternative)
  - wood glue
  - Nuts and Bolts
  - Miniture Servo
  - RaspberryPi, and RaspberryPi Camera
  - Accelerator and OLED display
  - battery (5v at least)

### Priorities 
 The necessary aspects of the blimp are for it to be a lightweight (but well built for endurance)  and fully enclosed structure. The ability of launch and flight as well as a safe and controlled return (the building of a controller may be nescessary), and lastly data recording through imaging.
