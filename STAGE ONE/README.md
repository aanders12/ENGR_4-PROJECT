# DEVELOPING THE IDEA
We started this project with the intention to build a blimp from scratch. 
This meant we needed to brainstorm, troubleshoot, and explore are own possibilities of creativity and skill.

Stage one consist of janky prototypes and forgotten ideas that set the foundation for our finalized project.
Stage one is the beginning of curation.
